This is an incomplete project. Features that have been implemented so far:
1) A disk controller that can read/write from and to the disk (called vdisk in this case)
2) A bit vector struct and helper methods to set/clear bits. This will be used more in the next steps
3) Test 1 checks if writing to disk is working properly

Issues faced:
1) Seemingly trivial, I could not get bool data type to work so i just used Constants
